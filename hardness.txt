1 - 2.6
2 - 2 (probably 1, but optimization is fun)
3 - 1
4 - 2 (probably 1, optimization)
4 - 2
5 - 3
6 - 3
7 - 2
8 - 3 (spent too much time with useless kd-tree, so timing is like 4)

1 - just code it
2 - easy one with a twist
2.6 - easy one with a twist or/and have to look for minor help.
3 - ok, not a hard but takes some time
3.8 - ok, but used some minor help or advise (algo to use, cache to implement, etc)
4 - harder one, no help
4.3 - harder one, no help, ton of time
4.5 - harder one, need some help or advise
5 - hard, ton of time and need a help, maybe just some other code gets adapted
